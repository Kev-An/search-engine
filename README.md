This is a custom search engine built using ReactJS with the Vite development server, the apporach I took for this project was to use three different API's.
Google's programmable search engine, Youtube Data API and PubMed API, I created three different components for the respective API's each with it's own search input.
The user interface has 3 simple buttons to switch between the platforms to search.
1) To run the project clone this project into VSCode.

2) Open the terminal and input the command "cd main" to navigate into the project directory.
   
3) Input the command "npm i" to install all the necessary dependencies to run the application.

4) Start the server using the command "npm run dev".
